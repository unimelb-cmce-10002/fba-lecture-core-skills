## Learning Goals

By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:

- Identify the eight core skills that underpin effective business analytics.
- Explain how each skill helps analysts tackle business problems using data.
- Distinguish between different types of skills (e.g., technical, strategic, communicative) and their roles.
- Reflect on how your individual strengths align with different analytics skill areas, and how diverse skill sets contribute to effective teams.

# Becoming a Business Scientist

## More Than Just Tools

**Expectations**:

- How to write code  
- How to build charts  
- How to fit models  

**\alert{Versus Reality}**: Using data to **\alertc{tackle messy, ambiguous, and important}** business problems.

This version of reality requires:

- Judgement  
- Sharp, answerable questions  
- Knowing which tools to use—and when


## The Business Scientist Mindset

::: {.column width="60%"}

Doing business analytics means **thinking before coding**:

- Understand context  
- Frame the problem  
- Choose between different approaches  

\vspace{0.25cm}

So a **business scientist** needs to  **\alertc{blends data, domain knowledge, and structured reasoning}** to guide better decisions.

This has **direct implications for** their skill set and their **skill acquisition**

# The 8 Skills of a Business Scientist

## Institutional Detail: Understanding the Business World

Businesses don’t operate in a vacuum. Need to **take time to understand**:

- Customers, competitors, suppliers, regulations, industry norms
- How the organization works

**\alert{Why it matters}**:

- Avoids misinterpreting the data  
- Helps frame better questions  
- Reveals meaningful patterns—and filters out misleading ones  

**Institutional detail** is **\alertb{not a distraction}** — it **\alert{sharpens analysis}**.

## Data Discovery: Finding the Right Data

**Real-world data is messy, scattered, and incomplete**. 

- Look across spreadsheets, dashboards, databases, websites—even emails  
- Combine technical know-how with social intelligence to find what's useful  
- Ask: What gets measured? What doesn’t—and why?

Sometimes, the data you *want* doesn’t exist. **\alert{Find workarounds}**:

- Use proxies  
- Collect new data  
- Reframe the question  


## Business Theory: Understand People and Firms

We need to understand the **motivations, incentives, and constraints** behind those decisions.

**Business theory**:

- Gives you **mental models for making sense of patterns**  
- Helps move from *what* happened → *why* it happened → *what* might happen next  
- Frames data through concepts from management strategy, consumer psychology, and economics  

Implication: **\alert{Business scientists}**...

- **\alert{Think in trade-offs, incentives}**, and feedback loops  
- **\alert{Know}** that **\alert{behavior is}** often patterned—and **\alert{interpretable}** 

## Analytical Modelling: Choose the Right Tool  

Business scientists match **tool complexity** to **task complexity**.

Key questions to ask:

- Do we need a causal estimate — or a predictive, or descriptive?
- How do we balance **accuracy** vs **interpretability**?

The **\alert{best model}** is the one that **\alert{fits the question, the data, and the decision context}**.

And sometimes, **no model is the right choice**:

- A table or chart may tell the story best  
- Judgment matters: not every question is ready for modelling  

## Analytical Theory: Know What Can Go Wrong

**Misleading analysis** leads to **bad decisions**.

Business scientists need to:

- **Think critically** about what the data really shows  
- Question their own models and conclusions  
- Understand what their analysis **can—and can’t—say**

This is a version of **statistical thinking**:

- Are we measuring what we think we are?  
- Could something else explain this pattern?  
- Would the conclusion change with different data?  
- What assumptions are we making—and are they reasonable?

Being **\alert{skeptical}** isn’t being negative—it **\alert{makes your work trustworthy}**, not just impressive.

## Computational Skills: Work with Code and Technology

Today’s business scientists work with code, tools like R to make our analysis:

- Faster  
- Clearer  
- More reproducible  

This isn’t about becoming a software engineer. It’s about **\alert{solving data problems efficiently}**.

Modern business analytics spans:

- Spreadsheets, databases, dashboards, cloud tools, models  
- Often different and continually newer platforms/models, but
- Consistent mindset: **Break problems into steps, fix what breaks, and automate the rest.**

## Presentation & Communication: Communicating what you find

Business scientists shape findings into clear, purposeful stories:

- **\alert{Tailor to your audience}**: executives want clarity, analysts want detail  
- Use graphs, slides, and writing to highlight what matters  
- **\alert{Focus}** on what the data or model shows ... and **\alert{what to do about it}**  

Good communication means:

- Clean visuals  
- Clear structure  
- Sharp recommendations  

The goal isn’t to impress — it’s to **\alert{help decision makers think clearly and act}**.


## Creativity & Judgment: Asking the Right Questions

Business scientists:

- Turn vague goals into **\alert{clear, testable questions}**  
- Use **\alert{creativity}** to reframe problems  
- Use **\alert{judgment}** to focus on what matters  

You won’t always get a clean brief:

- Sometimes the question is too broad  
- Sometimes the data leads somewhere unexpected  

The best analysts **\alert{act like investigators}** — curious, focused, and grounded in business relevance.

## Applying and Combining the Skills

Not every business scientist uses every skill equally.

Some skills are **\alert{universal}**:

- Understanding the business world  
- Finding the right data  
- Communicating what you find  
- Asking the right questions  

Other skills are **context-dependent**:

- Understanding people and firms  
- Choosing the right tool  
- Knowing what can go wrong  
- Working with code and technology  

The goal isn’t to master everything—it’s to know what matters most for the problems you’re solving.

## Building a Versatile Skill Set

You can't master all eight skills at once. But you can **build them over time**.

Grow through:

- **Projects** — real problems build real skill  
- **Courses** — pick what fits your goals  
- **Collaboration** — learn from others  
- **Reflection** — ask what worked, what didn’t  

**\alert{Stay curious. Stay self-aware. Keep learning}**.


# Analytics in the Age of Generative AI

## Why Human Judgment Still Matters

AI can (usually) write code, generate charts, and surface patterns. But it can’t:

- Understand business context  
- Judge what matters  
- Navigate politics or ambiguity  
- Communicate with nuance  


Implication: AI can help spot patterns—but **only people know what they mean, why they matter, and what to do next**.

Use AI as a **tool**, not a replacement
 
* Good analysts use AI to work faster—**not to think less**.

# Recap

## Wrap Up

\textbf{\alert{Today we discussed that}}:

- Business analytics is more than tools—it's a mindset grounded in context, curiosity, and judgment.  
- Great business scientists combine 8 core skills with role-specific strengths to solve real problems.  
- In an AI-powered world, human insight matters more than ever—use AI to accelerate thinking, not replace it.
